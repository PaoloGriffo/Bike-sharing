MS Thesis work on selection and model validation with the delta Bic. 

The aim of the thesis is to implement an automatic procedure to select and validate a statistical model through the use of the delta Bic. 
The procedure was applied to the case of multiple linear regression, analyzing the number of random accesses to the bike sharing service in the city of Washington D.C., during the weekends in the years 2011 and 2012. The stability of the model was assessed in three distinct cases; the first time the sample of observations of the 2011-2012 weekends is considered and in the second and third time the sub-samples are considered separately. In each sub-test, 90% and 80% of the original and non-anomalous data are resampled respectively.
